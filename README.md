# Authorship-Detector

A program to detect the author of a book given known writings of various authors

Using JavaFX and machine learning an authorship program was created that uses linguistic characteristics of various books to generate a cumulative score per author.

After uploading books (freely available online) with their known authors or uploading a premade author_signature txt (one has been provided) the program will attempt to guess the author of a mystery book based on the established options.
